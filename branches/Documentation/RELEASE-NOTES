     supported. Please also note that libspoton.so does not provide
     authenticated encryption.
2.   Set the error parameter in spoton_crypt::generatePrivatePublicKeys()
     if generateNTRUKeys() fails. A failure will be properly contained,
     however, it will not be reported correctly to the user.
3.   Added the terminal option question-answer to the kernel in support
     of changes produced in version 0.14.
4.   Removed ARM and PowerPC project files.
5.   Added A.E. tokens to client neighbors. Please see the Neighbors tab.

     user interface. Spot-On should not assume complete responsibility
     for user decisions.
18.  Per Schmidt, ability to lock StarBeam mosaics. Please remove
     the starbeam.db database. Because of the asynchronous nature of Spot-On,
     write permissions of native files are discarded if mosaics are locked.
19.  Do not update Listeners, Neighbors, and StarBeam widgets unless the
     widgets are visible.
20.  The Super Echo must not interfere with echo modes.

     data that has not been committed. This will eliminate
     some blocking. Also enable sharing of the SQLite cache.
     The cache is not enabled on OS X.
9.   Do not issue waitForConnected() after a connection attempt in the kernel.

0.13 (09/27/2014)

1.   The method spoton_misc::authenticateAccount() should assume that
     the provided hash exists in listeners_accounts_consumed_authentications.
     This assumption will strengthen the method against SQLite failures.
2.   Partial NTRU support for FreeBSD, Linux, OS X, and Windows. Please see
     spot-on-gui.pro for sample integration. NTRU signatures are not
     implemented.
3.   Added support for re-encoding e-mail attachments.
4.   Corrected saving of attachments.

     method returns a failure if the provided data parameter is empty
     or if the provided data parameter's encrypted portion is empty.
10.  Corrected compilation error on FreeBSD.

0.12 (09/19/2014)

1.   Corrected ARM project files.
2.   Single e-mail attachments. Limited in size.

     problematic.
6.   Remove broken transmitted_magnets and transmitted_scheduled_pulses
     entries in spot-on-reencode.cc.
7.   Removed foreign key support for new installations. The previous
     usage was incorrect and redundant.

1.   Calling over geminis.
2.   Corrected management of spoton_kernel::s_connectionCounts and
     s_remoteConnections.
3.   File encryption tool. The encrypted file will be approximately 0.5%
     larger than the original file.

     would automatically share public key pairs with participants
     that were previously accepted.
5.   Clear sensitive containers in spot-on-crypt.cc.
6.   Corrected dialog titles.
7.   Removed support for the gost28147 cipher.

11.  Upgraded SQLite to version 3.8.6 on Windows.

0.09.09 (08/17/2014)

1.   Include timestamps when computing A.E. hashes. This will help
     avoid some replay attacks. The delta between timestamps must be
     less than or equal to five seconds. Please remove your A.E. tokens.
     Client: compute E(timestamp) and H(E(x) + E(timestamp)).
     Server: verify H(...), compute D(E(...)) and verify timestamp
     delta. Replaying a recorded message will circumvent the verification
     if the server has not viewed the particular message (congestion control)
     and if the timestamp difference is within the acceptance window.
     Tokens must contain at least ninety-six characters.
2.   Some emoticons.
3.   Removed ALTER TABLE statements from spot-on-misc.cc.
4.   Limit the number of connections per client IP.
     Default is 10. The maximum is 50. Please see the Listeners tab.
     Local to local connections are not limited.
5.   The method spoton_misc::isAcceptedIP() must return false if it's
     provided an invalid host address. The method
     spoton_misc::isIpBlocked() must return true if it's provided an invalid
     host address.
6.   The method spoton_listener_tcp_server::incomingConnection() neglected
     to provide a peer port to newConnection().
7.   Data containing valid A.E. information must not be super echoed.
8.   Eliminated the expensive bridge signal spoton_kernel::receivedMessage().
9.   Removed excess base-64 computations. The changes will save computing and
     networking resources. For example, a 2485-byte array may require
     3316 bytes of storage. That's like a 25.06% consumption increase.
     Previous compatibility lost. Apologies.
10.  Maximum passphrase length has been set to 128.
11.  Remove entries from the post_office table if their dates are invalid.
12.  Use GCRY_MD_FLAG_SECURE in gcry_md_open() as it is not clear
     if gcry_md_setkey() maintains the provided key in secure memory.
13.  spoton_neighbor's m_useAccounts variable must be set correctly if
     an active neighbor that has not yet authenticated an account has its
     account credentials modified.
14.  Removed the extra hash congestion container. Also, instead of storing
     QDateTime objects, store uint values.
15.  Removed support for the Tiger hash algorithm.
16.  Use trimmed() wisely.
17.  The various slotSetIcons() methods must validate the gui/iconSet
     value.

     sizes have also been increased.
23.  Do not echo approved StarBeam data.
24.  Corrected buddies in various UI files.
25.  Added a hash type menu in the Kernel section of the Settings panel.
     Not yet functional.
26.  Include authentication information in StarBeam data encrypted via novas.
27.  Upgraded Qt to version 5.3.1 on OS X.
28.  A server may solicit account information from a client without
     a client initiating the authentication. Corrected.
29.  Upgraded OpenSSL products to version 1.0.1i on OS X and Windows
     platforms.
30.  Upgraded libgcrypt to version 1.5.4 on OS X.
31.  Upgraded libgpg-error to version 1.13 on OS X.
32.  Added basic support for ECDSA and EdDSA.

5.   Corrected binding of NULL values: QVariant::ByteArray for BLOB,
     QVariant::String for TEXT.
6.   The file spot-on-neighbors.txt should not be processed after
     re-encoding if spot_on_neighbors_txt_processed is true.

     type was ignored.
5.   Improved validation of magnets in spot-on-misc.cc methods.
6.   Avoid sending status broadcasts if the kernel does not have
     at least one attached interface. The interfaces() method should
     also determine whether or not the discovered sockets offer encrypted
     communications.
7.   Prevent recursive invocations of signal handlers. Also wish to
     pass the signal number to _Exit().
8.   Corrected a flaw with the StarBeam implementation. The mechanism
     prohibited transferring of files having sizes less than the specified
     pulse sizes.
9.   Upgraded SQLite to version 3.8.5 on Windows.
10.  Removed use of Qt's geometry() and setGeometry(). Use restoreGeometry()
     and saveGeometry() instead. Used previously for Gnome support.
     Removed spoton_misc::isGnome().

     idiotes.db.
13.  Placed lock guards over read-write locks so that locks are unlocked
     if critical sections throw exceptions.
14.  Corrected flawed if-statements. Spot nodes are allowed to be
     configured such that private keys are not required. Spot should not
     prohibit users from adding participant keys if such configurations
     exist.
15.  Improved the IP blocking mechanism. The new implementation aborts
     blocked connections immediately after connections are established.
16.  Added support for allowing connections from accepted IP addresses
     as well as blocking connections for SCTP servers.

1.   Buzz salts are now mandatory.
2.   Added logic provided by the Schmidt for minimal displays.
3.   Removed logging from spoton_buzzpage's destructor as the text includes
     key information. Problem is apparent if logging is enabled in the user
     interface.
4.   Purging of silent neighbors should occur regardless of connection
     states.
5.   Corrected the kernel's OS X Qt 5.x project file.
6.   Upgraded Qt to 4.8.6 on OS X.
7.   Added GeoIP IPv6 path. On Linux platforms, the location of

     Thanks to maandree.
8.   Corrected error text in spot-on-crypt.cc.
9.   The method spoton_crypt::initializePrivateKeyContainer() should be
     private.
10.  spoton_crypt::publicKeyDecrypt() should verify that the private
     key is valid via gcry_pk_testkey(). On failure, m_privateKey
     should be purged.
11.  Although idiotes.db contains encrypted data, private_key and
     public_key data may be swapped. spot-on-crypt retrieval methods
     ought to inspect data before sharing it.
12.  Corrected label text with respect to key count information.
13.  The method spoton_crypt::generatePrivatePublicKeys() must reset
     the m_publicKey container. Otherwise, stale data may be returned
     by spoton_crypt::publicKey().
14.  Added access guards to several spoton_crypt class members.
15.  Completed messages of the day. Plaintext messages are sent about
     thirty seconds after connections are established.
16.  Removed SIGKILL handler.
17.  Inspect data pointers in read() and write() methods. Verify that
     size variables are non-negative. Field large write() values.
18.  Relaxed definition of spoton_misc::isGnome().
19.  Upgraded Qt to version 5.2.1 on OS X. Removed use of fusion on OS X.
20.  Corrected congestion containers percent arithmetic.
21.  Corrected Documentation/MESSAGES, 0040a and 0040b. Algorithms
     such as Stribog, Tiger, and Whirlpool are also supported.
22.  Increased the general and table timers from 2.5 seconds to 3.5 seconds
     in the user interface.
23.  Added the file spot-on-neighbors.txt. Spot will process the contents
     of the file after a new installation or if the configuration option
     spot_on_neighbors_txt_processed is set to false. Neighbor connection
     states will be set to disconnected. Please note that the file is
     expected to reside within the directory that houses the Spot-On
     executable.
24.  Added a default Buzz developer's channel.
25.  Ignore abstract messages having inconsistent lengths. Such messages
     are not to be echoed.
26.  Modified the thread model. The new approach uses more events
     and less timer cycles. Let's hope we don't have some delicious
     race conditions.
27.  Qt 5.3 preparations for OS X.

0.09.04 (04/17/2014)

1.   Use qstrcmp() instead of qstrncmp().
2.   Corrected memcpy() instances in IPv6 branches of SCTP files.
     (Use memcpy(&tmp.c, ...) instead of memcpy(&tmp, ...).)
3.   qgetenv() returns a byte array.
4.   Public keys of other participants will now be encrypted. Please
     remove friends_public_keys.db. Apologies.
5.   Corrected re-encoding of participants data. The current
     implementation neglected empty gemini data.
6.   Select SQL queries should be forward only.
7.   Most database writes will now be synchronized.
8.   Absorb memory failures in the kernel.
9.   Avoid zero-length memory allocations.
10.  Added e-mail institutions. This small change attempts to resemble
     physical entities. Please remove email.db. Modified message type 0001b.
     Institutions will now be able to house 3rd-party e-mail without needing
     to distribute their public keys. Do note that care should be taken to
     safeguard the symmetric keys. Please also note that e-mail destined
     for institutions will be echoed.
11.  Replaced timer-based excessive-data purging from neighbors with
     data-motivated mechanisms.
12.  Corrected tab key navigation.
13.  Process kernel statistics in a specialized thread.
14.  The method spoton_misc::allParticipantsHaveGeminis() should return
     false if the participants pool is empty.
15.  Upgraded OpenSSL libraries to version 1.0.1g on OS X and Windows.
16.  Replaced message 0002 with 0002a. Added 0002b (e-mail retrieval)
     in support of institutions. Message 0002b will be echoed.
17.  The methods spoton_misc::isAcceptedParticipant(),
     spoton_misc::publicKeyFromHash(),
     spoton_misc::publicKeyFromSignaturePublicKeyHash(), and
     spoton_misc::signaturePublicKeyFromPublicKeyHash() neglected to
     close the database handles. Corrected.
18   Improved performance of spoton_neighbor::findMessageType() by
     inspecting group counts.
19.  Terminate timers in destructors.
20.  Removed random selection of ciphers. The default cipher has
     been set to AES-256.
21.  Do not review a client's authentication claims if the client
     has already been authenticated.
22.  Server objects should belong to listener objects and not
     to the kernel.
23.  One ought to remove socket objects from the kernel's interface
     listener. The objects are removed during termination.
24.  Version 0.09.03's item #3 introduced several errors. Corrected.
25.  More protection of shared data in spoton_neighbor.
26.  Per Schmidt, added the Minimal option beneath the View menu.
     Incomplete.

0.09.03 (03/28/2014)

1.   Added a timer to the UI to inspect states of chat windows.
2.   Corrected default value of keepOnlyUserDefinedNeighbors in
     spoton_misc::cleanupDatabases().
3.   Added a WHERE clause to spoton_kernel::prepareNeighbors() since
     we're only interested in initializing user-defined neighbors
     within this method.
4.   QSqlQuery::lastInsertId() may return an invalid value. Modified
     spoton_listener::slotNewConnection() so that a database transaction
     is created before a remote neighbor's information is recorded.
     If lastInsertId() fails, the transaction is canceled.
5.   RSA_up_ref() must not be given an invalid pointer. Corrected.
6.   Inspect argv[] in the main() function of spot-on-kernel.cc.
7.   Created the method spoton_misc::vacuumAllDatabases() along with the
     kernel option vacuum. Please note that this option should not be
     used if there is an active interface.
     (https://sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html)
8.   Corrected dataSize, pulseSize, etc. comparisons in
     spoton_starbeam_writer::slotProcessData().
9.   Experimental SCTP support for Windows. Please also see item #10.
10.  Redesigned the SCTP implementation. Socket notifiers are troublesome
     in Windows. The new implementations shall use simple timers. Please
     note that socket state information may not be reflected in a timely
     manner. Please also see item #9.
11.  Review socket() results in spoton_sctp_server::listen().
12.  Kernel registration is now forced by default.
13.  Corrected version 0.09.02's item #20. A node without an interface
     would not store offline e-mail.
14.  Improper use of memcmp() in spot-on-kernel.cc. Use qstrncmp() instead.
15.  Removed install targets from Windows project files.
16.  Removed the archives directory.
17.  Replaced malloc() with calloc() in libspoton.c. Version increased
     to 0.05.
18.  Corrected inconsistent toLatin1() usage in
     spoton_crypt::generateCertificate().

0.09.02 (03/12/2014)

1.   Review QDataStream::operator>>() results in spoton_crypt.
2.   Prevent multiple calls to SSL_library_init() in spoton_crypt::init().
3.   The method spoton_crypt::saltedValue() did not properly
     exit on several failures.
4.   Allow renaming of Rosetta participants.
5.   Process user configuration changes in the kernel in a less timely manner.
     The previous real-time mechanism is not necessary.
6.   Added the StarBeam Analyzer for discovering missing links. Please
     see the Tools menu.
7.   Upgraded SQLite libraries to version 3.8.3.1 on Windows.
8.   Added the Pulse Size field to the 0060 message. This addition will
     correctly identify pule sizes to receivers because the Data Size
     may be smaller than the Pule Size. The change severs compatibility with
     previous releases.
9.   Do not disconnect user-defined neighbors when a listener's list of
     acceptable IP addresses is modified.
10.  Do not clear m_errorString in spoton_sctp_server::close(). Also, record
     more errors.
11.  Store authentication information with encrypted data.
     For a given database field, the stored data will now be
     H_hash_key(E_encryption_key(x)) || E_encryption_key(x). Please reset
     Spot.
12.  The method spoton_crypt::reencodeKeys() has been redesigned per
     item #11.
13.  Corrected an error with Rosetta text. Newline characters were lost
     because of toPlainText() usage.
14.  The function X509_get_subject_name() may fail. Inspect its return value.
15.  The ssl_session_cipher database field may be empty. The interface assumed
     otherwise.
16.  Added a signal handler to the user interface. The handler is to be used
     for issuing a GCRYCTL_TERM_SECMEM.
17.  Corrected kernel version information.
18.  Corrected query.lastInsertId() conversion in
     spoton_listener::slotNewConnection(). The id variable is of type
     qint64 whereas the converted value was of type int.
19.  QVariant::toInt() may overflow without the overflow being detected.
     Qt documentation states that Qt 5 will resolve this issue.
     The new approach is to convert values to long-long.
20.  Corrected message 0001a. The correction introduces another group member.
     Previous-version compatibility ruined. The corrected approach introduces
     a new hash key that is only known to the participant and not the carrier.
     Separate message codes are also required.
21.  The method spoton_misc::findGeminiInCosmos() may return results
     that are incorrect. The local container gemini must be cleared
     after each loop iteration.
22.  Include the requester's hash when computing the digital signature for
     message 0002 (e-mail retrieval).
23.  Added Microsoft.VC90.CRT.manifest and msvcr90.dll to
     libOpenSsl/Libraries.win32.

0.09.01 (02/20/2014)

1.   Qt documentation suggests that some socket options should be
     set after the connected() signal is emitted. Corrected.
2.   Experimental SCTP support, where available. The macro SPOTON_SCTP_ENABLED
     must be specified in the appropriate project file. Please note
     that SSL/TLS and proxy support are not provided for SCTP.
     The model implemented is one-to-one.
3.   Upgraded Qt products to version 5.2.1 on Windows.
4.   Abort the kernel on invalid command-line options.
5.   Buzz hash keys are now mandatory. Corrected a key uniqueness
     error.
6.   The connect() and disconnect() methods in
     spoton::slotBuzzActionsActivated() referenced an incorrect SLOT.
     Resolved.
7.   The 2nd Clear option under Buzz reset the wrong Iteration Count
     widget (Settings).
8.   The iteration count under Settings assumed an incorrect minimum of
     1000 instead of 10000. Corrected.
9.   Corrected spoton_neighbor::slotDisconnected(). The intent of the
     method is to re-connect to a peer if the peer does not provide
     SSL over TCP and if the client does not require SSL.
10.  Ability to change user names in Chat, E-Mail, and URLs tabs.
11.  Corrected spoton_crypt::passphraseSet(). The gui/saltedPassphraseHash
     is stored as a byte array in the INI file.
12.  The method spoton::updateListenersTable() attempted to delete
     listener authentication data that may have already been deleted,
     causing some impolite noise.
13.  E-mail subjects are optional. The method
     spoton::applyGoldbugToInboxLetter() incorrectly processed empty
     e-mail subjects.
14.  Avoid setting the status field in friends_public_keys to 'offline'
     if the value of the field is already 'offline'.
15.  The protocol field in neighbors.db contains encrypted
     data. The methods spoton_listener::slotNewConnection() and
     spoton_misc::savePublishedNeighbor() disregarded this detail.

0.09.00 (02/07/2014)

1.   Use a separate key for computing local keyed hashes. Keyed hashes provide
     uniqueness to database entries. Please reset Spot. Apologies. Keys
     are derived as follows:
          key_temporary = derive(passphrase, cipher_block_length + 256)
          key_encryption, key_hash = derive(key_temporary)
          (0...cipher_block_length - 1), (cipher_block_length...256)
2.   Removed obsolete methods from the spoton_crypt class.
3.   The mechanisms that are responsible for copying chat and e-mail public
     key pairs incorrectly used the encryption keys for computing keyed
     hashes.
4.   Set the default intervals of the external IP fetch mechanisms to -1.
5.   Corrected Documentation/MESSAGES.
6.   Added certificate information to neighbor summaries.
7.   Introduced byte-by-byte hash comparisons to lessen timing analysis.
8.   Added the database table listeners_accounts_consumed_authentications. The
     contents of the table shall be purged whenever the owning listener
     is deactivated or deleted. The table shall contain data that has been
     used for authenticating accounts so as to avoid potential replay attacks.
     Data older than 120 seconds are also purged. Please also see item #31.
9.   Account authentication is now allowed over plain TCP connections.
10.  Added various reflection widgets.
11.  Ability to copy e-mail key pairs of participants. Please note that copied
     data does not include signatures. As a result, spoton::addFriendsKey()
     has been weakened.
12.  Asymmetric key generation is now optional during Spot initialization.
     Modified spoton_crypt::reencodeKeys() so that the method behaves
     if keys are absent.
13.  Added the macro SPOTON_USE_HIDDEN_KERNEL_WINDOW. If defined, the kernel
     will launch a window object. The gui module should be defined in the
     respective project file.
14.  Added support for single-use accounts. Please remove listeners.db.
15.  Use INSERT OR REPLACE when inserting listener accounts.
16.  Added a basic impersonator. Please see Chat.
17.  Added the Edit menu.
18.  Encrypted database transport value.
19.  Added the orientation field to listeners.db and neighbors.db.
     Please remove the databases. Current values: packet and stream.
     Please note that this is a partial implementation.
20.  The method spoton_misc::savePublishedNeighbor() incorrectly trusted
     the transport parameter. Adjusted. Also relaxed inspection of the
     statusControl parameter.
21.  Corrected a StarBeam issue with respect to the received check box. If
     the kernel was active, enabling receivers did not function properly.
22.  Empty Buzz hash keys caused display issues. Corrected.
23.  Use clang++ on FreeBSD.
24.  Use QSqlQuery::lastInsertId() instead of custom queries. SQLite does
     support the feature.
25.  Chat pop-up windows malfunctioned. Corrected. Also improved text
     reflections.
26.  Corrected vanishing SHA-1 hashes of received mosaics. Please remove
     starbeam.db. Please note that computing hashes of live mosaics
     may be produce invalid results.
27.  Corrected a deep flaw with the StarBeam protocol. The protocol
     echoed data on incorrect channels. Echoes should not be reflected.
28.  Added re-encoding of gemini data.
29.  Corrected "Error Opening file GeoIP.dat" messages.
30.  Added the version command-line option to the kernel.
31.  Introduced authentication timers. Default timeouts set to 15 seconds.
     Please also see item #8.
32.  Introduced export and import of public key pairs. Please see the
     Tools menu.
33.  Modified all kernel QMutex objects to be of type QReadWriteLock.
     Let's hope for some additional concurrency.
34.  The name field in Rosetta lacked a maximum length. Corrected.
35.  Added remote connection timeouts. Values: 2.5 seconds and 5.0 seconds if
     a proxy is set.
36.  The method spoton_gui_server_tcp_server::incomingConnection() must
     close the provided socket descriptor if spoton_crypt::generateSslKeys()
     fails.
37.  Removed duplicate 'if(country == "Algeria")' in
     spoton::pixmapForCountry().
38.  Congestion control is now mandatory.
39.  Added motd to listeners.db and neighbors.db. Please remove the
     databases. Fields not yet used.
40.  Removed most activateWindow() references.
41.  Added the Force Registration option to the Settings tab.
42.  Removed PID comparison in libspoton_register_kernel(). A forced
     registration is now absolute.
43.  The method spoton_crypt::init() incorrectly inspected the variable
     m_cipherAlgorithm after the call to gcry_cipher_open(). The
     variable m_cipherHandle must be validated instead.
44.  Because id uniqueness cannot be guaranteed on Buzz channels,
     spoton_buzzpage::userStatus() has been updated so that it adjusts
     all discovered clients.
45.  Re-enabled the URLs tab. Please note that most of the functionality
     within this tab is incomplete.
46.  Added a simple data timer to the spoton_neighbor class. The timer
     will be activated, if not currently active, whenever new socket
     data is read. If the read data is deemed acceptable, the timer will
     be reset. The timer's interval is set to 15 seconds.
47.  Removed use of Qt::DirectConnection in spoton_neighbor::run().
     Processing socket data must occur within the spoton_neighbor
     thread.
48.  Modified default acceptance of shared key settings. Default: false.
49.  Removed archived versions 0.01 through 0.07 from the source tree.
     Archived 0.08.
50.  Ability to hide the Statistics panel in Settings. Removed the extra
     Reset Spot-On push button.
51.  Notify the user of order disturbances in messaging. Removed obsolete
     hash computations.
52.  Removed the table received_pulses from starbeam.db. Added
     pulse_size to the received table. Please remove starbeam.db. It's
     not practical to record data concerning received pulses. Instead,
     a future option will locate discontinuities within a mosaic.
53.  The method spoton_crypt::saltedPassphraseHash() did not exit properly
     if the provided passphrase or salt were empty. Corrected. Also, inspect
     the provided hash type.
54.  All versions of spoton_crypt::keyedHash() failed to set
     the validation parameters to true on success. Corrected.
55.  Some minimal inspection of hashes should be performed before comparing
     them.
56.  Replaced C-style casts. Removed redundant casts.
57.  Strip dead code from OS X binaries.
58.  Upgraded Qt products to version 5.2.0 on Windows.
59.  Changed default value of Keep Only User-Defined Neighbors from false
     to true.
60.  The method spoton_misc::isAcceptedParticipant() lacked a key type
     parameter. Corrected.
61.  Under certain conditions, QDataStream failures may cause
     gcry_cipher_encrypt() to function properly. Corrected.
62.  Corrected Received table selections.
63.  The method spoton_kernel::connectSignalsToNeighbor() may be
     issued several times per neighbor object. Added Qt::UniqueConnection
     to all connect() instances.
64.  Discovered a fundamental flaw with the design of the kernel with
     respect to the thread objects. The kernel was artificially threaded.
     Corrected. Applied a similar correction to the StarBeam writer.
65.  Prevent the log viewer from processing too much data. Limit the file
     size to 0.5 MiB. Also, do not read log data unless the viewer is visible.
66.  Corrected furious timer (m_accountTimer) in spoton_neighbor.
67.  Updated OpenSSL to version 1.0.1f on Windows.
68.  Removed most instances of AbstractSocket::abort().
69.  The method spoton_kernel::slotMessagingCachePurge() failed to protect
     the s_messagingCache object from access by multiple threads. Corrected.
70.  The method spoton_crypt::randomCipherType() will return aes256 if
     the random cipher is empty.
71.  Adjust gui/hashType in spoton_misc::correctSettingsContainer().
     Added other various bounds checks.
72.  Removed excessive trimmed().
73.  Inspect results of indexOf().
74.  Respect desired congestion costs. That is, remove older entries
     from the messaging cache if the current size is too large.
75.  Decreased the maximum name length from 64 to 16 characters.
76.  Partially neglected to inspect Buzz message authentication codes in the
     kernel. Corrected.

0.08.00 (12/23/2013)

1.   Archived the 0.06 branch.
2.   Added the Rosetta converter. Please see the Tools menu.
3.   Corrected the e-mail retrieval mechanism. The mechanism malfunctioned
     if the interface of the c/o node was inactive.
4.   Completed implementation of spoton::copyMyUrlPublicKey(). Various
     changes in preparation of URL public keys are also included.
5.   Added verification of URL encryption and signature public keys.
6.   Method const-correctness.
7.   Added a minor feature for regenerating public key pairs. Please see
     the Settings panel.
8.   Corrected use of activateWindow(). The method should only be called
     if the window is minimized. Otherwise, the activated window will
     befuddle the current window.
9.   Support for textbook ElGamal signatures. ElGamal encryption is also
     considered textbook.
10.  The function gcry_md_setkey() accepts empty keys. Spot will
     consider such cases as errors.
11.  Corrected digital signatures with respect to DSA and ElGamal.

0.07.00 (12/19/2013)

1.   Corrected use of gcry_md_hash_buffer() in spoton_crypt::saltedValue().
     The input buffer was incorrectly resized. The method saltedValue() is
     currently used for authenticating remote accounts.
2.   Archived the 0.05 branch.
3.   Ability to set the Maximum Buffer Size and Maximum Content
     Length. Please see the Listeners table. New neighbors will inherit the
     settings of their parent listeners. Please remove listeners.db.
4.   Corrected various log entries and source comments.
5.   Corrected the Maximum Content Length lower bound.
6.   Reset the keep-alive timer before performing intense processing.
7.   Minor corrections to saveExternalAddress(): inspect spoton_crypt objects.
8.   Added SPOTON_LINKED_WITH_LIBPTHREAD macro to the various project files.
9.   The methods spoton_crypt::saltedValue() and
     spoton_crypt::saltedPassphraseHash should not trim the provided
     parameters. The passphrase parameter is trimmed, however.
10.  Removed the incomplete method spoton_crypt::privateKeyInRem().
11.  Corrected tab ordering.
12.  Allow editing of gemini cells.
13.  Removed all instances of QFileDialog::setFilter().
14.  Introduced the StarBeam Transfer Protocol. The protocol misbehaves as
     follows:
          Participants who are willing to export mosaics must create
          confidential magnets. Once defined, the magnets may then be
          distributed. Once the magnets are recorded by other devices,
          mosaics may then be exported. Mosaics are partitioned into specific
          pulses and randomly-selected magnets are applied to
          individual pulses. Receivers assemble the mosaic pieces as well as
          echo the received pulses. A replay option will be available for
          transmitters to retransmit requested pulses. Pulses are written
          in the interval [1000, 1500) (milliseconds).
15.  Removed many instances of spoton_misc::prepareDatabases(). Only
     a few instances are necessary.
16.  Implemented spoton_misc::allParticipantsHaveGeminis(). The method
     spoton_neighbor::findMessageType() may be exceptionally burdened if
     a node attempts to decipher asymmetric ciphertexts without cause.
     Unfortunately, falsified e-mail content may still weaken the method.
17.  Capture results of QSqlDatabase::open() whenever user interest
     is a concern.
18.  Corrected and updated Documentation/ENCRYPTED.
19.  Abbreviated array parameters of gpg_strerror_r() from 1024 bytes to
     64 bytes.
20.  Removed the country-based firewall. Please remove country_inclusion.db.
     The IP-based firewall has been modified such that the simple rules are
     applied per listener. Please remove accepted_ips.db and listeners.db.
     The keyword Any may be specified to allow connections from all external
     devices.
21.  Use INSERT OR REPLACE when adding new listener accounts.
22.  Renamed the Buzz magnet parameter dn to rn per request.
23.  Added gemini_hash_key to friends_public_keys.db. Please remove
     the database file.
24.  Modified spoton_misc::findGeminiInCosmos() so that the method
     attempts to discover the gemini pair via hash computations.
25.  Removed UTF-8 conversions for gemini keys.
26.  Added hash keys and types to Buzz channels. Modified communication
     protocols as well. Please note that if hash keys are not provided,
     they will assume slight variations of their channel keys counterparts.
27.  Corrected purging of destroyed Buzz data from the kernel.
28.  Removed UTF-8 conversions for Buzz channel names and goldbug keys.
29.  Increased many default buffer and key size values from 256 bytes
     to 512 bytes.
30.  The method spoton_neighbor::slotDisconnected() should destroy the
     server-side object.
31.  Ability to retrieve e-mail automatically, per request.
32.  Ability to reset certificates of disconnected clients.
33.  Random keep-alive timer intervals [30, 45) (seconds).
34.  Added support for UDP listeners and neighbors. Please note that
     SSL is not supported for the UDP transport layer. Please remove
     listeners.db and neighbors.db.
35.  Modified the accounts mechanism so that it's well-defined over
     plain connections in support of UDP. Please note that SSL is
     required for TCP connections with respect to accounts.
36.  Corrected re-encoding of listeners and neighbors. Scope IDs where
     not included when computing keyed hashes.
37.  Do not display certificate hashes of empty certificates (Neighbors).
38.  Added support for TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2, where available.
39.  Inspecting network interfaces in neighbor objects is not necessary
     because the keep-alive timers will sever damaged connections.
40.  Introduced sequence numbers and UTC times to Chat protocols in
     support of UDP commmunications.
41.  Replaced keep-alive messages with UUID transfers.
42.  Improved, perceived, echo performance.
43.  Must compare personal keys with shared keys.
44.  Corrected default congestion control settings in the kernel.
45.  Corrected recording of data with respect to congestion control and
     published listeners.
46.  Decreased cache purge timer intervals for Buzz and Chat to 30 seconds.
47.  Modified the congestion control mechanism within the kernel. The previous
     mechanism neglected to remove expired items in a timely manner. The new
     implementation may increase the kernel's memory footprint. Also decreased
     item expiration seconds to 30 seconds.
48.  Upgraded libgpg-error to version 1.12 and libgcrypt to version 1.5.3 on
     OS X.
49.  Removed table_row properties from various widgets. Not used.
50.  Corrected spoton_misc::correctSettingsContainer() with respect to the
     minimum congestion size (1000).
51.  Added kernel statistics to the interface. Please see Settings.
52.  Configurable intervals for fetching external IP addresses. Ability to
     disable requests also included.
53.  Corrected an issue with the certificate verification process.
     Certificates must be verified before connections are encrypted. Also,
     sever socket connections whenever peers are about to be destroyed. That
     is, don't depend on deleteLater(). Thanks R.
54.  Limit the maximum number of characters allowed to the passphrase
     command-line option to 64. Also remove non-printable characters from the
     input.
55.  Remove non-printable characters from listener accounts and passphrases.
     Proxy passwords remain as are.
56.  The method spoton_kernel::slotNewNeighbor() must inspect the quality of a
     discovered neighbor. If the peer was destroyed by an external event, the
     method must remove the existing trace. Otherwise, a new peer having the
     old peer's id will not be inserted properly.
57.  Display listener certificate fingerprints.
58.  Must update a listener's connection count after its neighbors are
     detached via the interface. Also corrected placement of
     updateConnectionCount() in spoton_listener::slotNewConnection().
59.  Corrected an index in spoton::applyGoldbugToInboxLetter(). The hash in
     the UPDATE statement must be the hash of the message and the subject
     and not the hash of the message and the receiver_sender_hash. Also
     corrected an issue with uniqueness constraints. If a folder contains
     duplicate messages that are encrypted, subsequent attempts to decrypt
     encrypted messages fails because of uniqueness violations.
60.  Corrected spoton_kernel::interfaces(). The method was returning
     inflated data.
61.  Allow sharing of Buzz magnets over encrypted sessions.
62.  Added UTC timestamps to the account authentication process to avoid
     replay issues beyond two-minute intervals.
63.  Instruct the kernel's UI server to adhere to the value of the
     SSL Control String.
64.  Decreased the keep-alive timer interval to 30 seconds from 45 seconds.
65.  Allow control of the secure memory pool sizes from the interface.
     Please see the Settings panel.
66.  Destroy the secure memory handler whenever a process exits.
67.  gcry_control(GCRYCTL_ENABLE_M_GUARD) may not be issued after
     gcry_check_version(). Corrected.
68.  gcry_control(GCRYCTL_SET_THREAD_CBS) must be issued before any other
     libgcrypt function for multi-threaded applications. Corrected.
69.  Increased the maximum buffer size to 10485760 bytes and the maximum
     content length to 5242880. Please remove listeners.db and neighbors.db.
70.  Set TCP read buffer sizes to the maximum buffer size settings.
71.  Corrected HTML font tags usage within QDateTime objects. Qt 5.2.0
     support.
72.  Corrected an error with the client-side account authentication
     implementation. Clients that have specified account names will now
     require authentication before transmitting other data.
73.  Items in various interface tables will now reflect decryption errors.
74.  Added support for the gost cipher and the stribog hash algorithm.
     These new algorithms may only be available in libgcrypt 1.6.0.
75.  Added fwrapv and Wstrict-overflow=4 to many project files.
76.  The account_authenticated database field will now contain encrypted
     data. Please remove neighbors.db.

0.06.00 (10/24/2013)

1.   Allow users of the libspoton library to store enough information
     so that the correct key can be generated. The changes will support
     future features.
2.   Corrected log messages.
3.   Corrected OS/2 UI project file. Corrections also applied to 0.05 branch.
     Thanks Elbert.
4.   Archived branches 0.01 through 0.04.
5.   Limit timer cycles in the kernel via file system watchers.
6.   The scrambler timer should be a single-shot timer.
7.   Corrected UI dialog information.
8.   ElGamal encryption key pairs. DSA and RSA signature key pairs.
     Please note that padding is not provided for ElGamal.
9.   Clear the neighbor summary correctly.
10.  Corrected recording of the kernel cipher type after a new
     installation.
11.  Allow neighbors to be defined such that plaintext connections
     are prohibited. Default: enabled. Please remove neighbors.db.
12.  Added a simple feature for testing the SSL Control String.
13.  More corrections to Documentation/ENCRYPTED.
14.  Updated OpenSSL libraries to version 1.0.1e on OS X. Libraries
     were generated from source.
15.  Added SSL_library_init() to spoton_crypt::init().
16.  Per-listener accounts. Please remove listeners.db. Accounts require
     SSL connections. May provide SRP support in the near future as current
     implementation is susceptible to at least a replay attack. Added the INI
     setting kernel/server_account_verification_window_msecs to control
     the response window, default of 15000 milliseconds.
17.  Improved error reporting between the user and the UI.
18.  Removed OS X and Qt 5.x workaround with respect to password widgets.
19.  Properly reset neighbors.db data in spoton_misc::cleanupDatabases().
20.  Disable Nagle's algorithm on all TCP sockets. The algorithm may
     be enabled via the INI file.
21.  Individual chat windows.
22.  The kernel shall now purge messages that are older than 60 seconds. Also
     decreased the purge timer from 30 seconds to 15 seconds. Please also
     see item #40.
23.  Removed the documentation browser. The information is incomplete and will
     be provided online instead.
24.  Spelling corrections to this file.
25.  Re-implemented QIODevice::write() so that the entire provided
     buffer is written in the spoton_neighbor class. A critical error
     shall prevent such a guarantee.
26.  Replaced strlen() with qstrlen() and qstrnlen().
27.  The SQL query in spoton_misc::participantCount() should include
     the neighbor_oid field as part of the where-clause.
28.  Corrected recording of certificates. Please remove the neighbors.db
     database as the peer_certificate field has been renamed to certificate.
29.  Removed most instances of init() from spoton_crypt.cc. The OpenSSL and
     gcrypt libraries should be initialized but once per process.
30.  Replaced gcry_strerror() with gpg_strerror_r() as gcry_strerror() is
     not thread-safe.
31.  Introduced threaded peers! Care has been taken so as to synchronize
     access to critical data.
32.  Removed local static variables.
33.  Purged flawed logic in spoton_misc::logError().
34.  Corrected a super echo flaw. Duplicate data should not be echoed.
35.  Reset the peer's keep-alive timer if duplicate data has arrived.
36.  Published listener information must be subjected to congestion control.
37.  Removed affluent log entries from spoton_crypt::decrypted() and
     spoton_crypt::publicKeyDecrypt().
38.  Corrected acceptance of participants. Accepting one key type caused
     the additional acceptance of another key type.
39.  Modified some SQL queries where SQL injections were potentially
     possible. Parameterized statements are now used where applicable.
     Reviewed all DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE statements.
40.  Modified the mechanism that's responsible for purging the congestion
     control cache so that it removes at least 15% of the cache's capacity
     during a purge event. Please also see item #22.
41.  Corrected spoton_misc::correctSettingsContainer() with respect
     to the congestion control and iteration count variables.
42.  Added PRAGMA synchronous = OFF statements to several UPDATE queries
     in the spoton_neighbor class. These changes should prevent
     heavy disk access whenever traffic is dense. However, data integrity
     may be slightly affected.
43.  Added support for favorite Buzz channels.
44.  Corrected a flaw which allowed duplicate Buzz channels. Also,
     the generated salt in spoton_buzzpage::spoton_buzzpage() should not
     be interpreted as Base-64.
45.  The total reset mechanism neglected to remove accepted_ips.db.
46.  Record generated data as it may be returned via echoes. Disregard
     duplicates.
47.  Corrected implementation of the Encrypt-then-MAC usage. One key
     should be used for encryption and a separate key for generating
     the MAC. Messages bundled by geminis include MACs signed via
     the geminis.
48.  The method spoton_misc::retrieveSymmetricData() must capture
     failures. Otherwise, unpleasant assumptions will be made. For example,
     generating and sharing empty symmetric keys.
49.  Inspect group size in spoton_neighbor::findMessageType() so as to avoid
     unnecessary computations. Please note that there is some computational
     redundancy with this method and some of the process() methods. Will be
     looked at in 0.07.

0.05.00 (09/16/2013)

1.   Simple IP-based firewall.
2.   Issue abort() instead of close() for drastic situations.
3.   Remove kernel.db in spot-on-kernel.cc's sig_handler() function.
4.   Do not allow users to add their own keys.
5.   Added kernel cipher type to the Settings page. Default: randomized.
6.   Replaced QT_POINTER_SIZE with sizeof(void *). The macro is not
     widely available.
7.   Completed spoton_crypt::defaultSslCiphers(). The method retrieves
     SSLv3 and TLSv1 ciphers according to
     HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!3DES:!EXPORT:@STRENGTH. However, the actual
     ciphers retained are also influenced by Qt. Qt is instructed to use
     the SSLv3 and TLSv1 protocols. The SSL control string may be modified
     via the UI.
8.   Modified spoton_crypt::setSslCiphers() so that the method prepares
     the provided QSslConfiguration object with preferred ciphers if the
     preferred ciphers are available.
9.   Corrected Documentation/ENCRYPTED.
10.  Ability to set permanent certificates for listeners. Peers will
     test certificates and discrepancies shall be logged. Please
     remove listeners.db and neighbors.db.
11.  Corrected re-encoding mechanism with respect to the neighbors.db
     database.
12.  Encrypt the protocol in the neighbors database table.
13.  Optional recording of external IP addresses in certificates
     when defining listeners.
14.  Removed all instances of QSslConfiguration::setProtocol(). Allow
     the protocol to be determined by the selected cipher.
15.  Include IP addresses and ports in important log entries.
16.  Corrected FreeBSD project files. Corrected previous branches too.
17.  The Buzz client tables should not contain editable fields. Corrected.
18.  Display certificate SHA-512 digests in the Neighbors table. Tool tips
     also.
19.  Increased scrambler timer interval to qrand() % 5000 + 10000.
20.  Added Bytes Read and Bytes Written columns to the Neighbors table.
     Please remove neighbors.db.
21.  Corrected SQL query in spoton_kernel::slotRetrieveMail(). The
     where-clause should have included key_type = 'email'.
22.  Eliminated socket read timers from neighbors.
23.  Corrected portions of the echo mode. Nodes having half-echo modes
     enabled should not pass received data to other nodes unless the
     Super Echo is enabled. Also, nodes that received messages from
     other nodes must echo the messages if the Super Echo is enabled.
24.  Display last status changes of participants in the Chat panel.
25.  Added OS/2 project files. Files provided by Elbert.
26.  If two peers share keys, the peer having the other peer's key will
     automatically accept that peer.
27.  Configurable tab position.
28.  Neighbor summary.
29.  Added iteration counts to Buzz channels.
30.  Added ssl_session_cipher to the neighbors database table. Please
     remove neighbors.db. Field contains encrypted data.

0.04.00 (09/03/2013)

1.   Per an anonymous e-mail passed on via another e-mail, I should
     perhaps add more keys! Please reset Spot. There shall now
     be a chat pair, an e-mail pair, and a url pair. And! Each pair
     shall have its own signature. A total of six pairs.
2.   Label (name) signature keys in the friends_public_keys database
     table by using their types. Only one person reads these release notes.
3.   Apologies. This time I will really bundle the Translations directory
     into the Windows release.
4.   Do not update the participant's name if the sender used a goldbug.
5.   The simple mechanism that's used to determine if a goldbug
     is set is deeply flawed. Corrected.
6.   The method spoton_neighbor::resetKeepAlive() incorrectly restarted
     the keep-alive timer. The timer is responsible for sending
     periodic notifications.
7.   Limit read() to 8192 bytes in spoton_neighbor::slotReadyRead().
8.   Also removed SPOTON_GEOIP_DATA_FILE from all kernel project files.
9.   Added tool tips of partial public key hashes to the Chat and
     E-Mail table items.
10.  Corrected X509_sign(x509, pk, EVP_md5()). Use EVP_sha512.
11.  Removed all instances of QSslConfiguration::setPeerVerifyMode
     (QSslSocket::VerifyNone).
12.  Record listener external or local address in the certificate. It's
     possible that an external address is not defined.
13.  Added bulk key copies.
14.  Retain geminis if participants are re-added.
15.  Renamed Documentation/PROTOCOLS to Documentation/MESSAGES.
16.  Added the Uptime field to the Neighbors table.
17.  Removed a bunch of "PRAGMA synchronous = OFF" statements.

0.03.00 (08/26/2013)

1.   Bundled the Translations directory in the OS X and Windows release
     files.
2.   Added brief tool tips to the Listeners and Neighbors tables.
3.   Shortened Buzz Client tool tips. The tool tips shall include the
     first and last sixteen characters of the IDs.
4.   Corrected mnemonics.
5.   New children of listeners must inherit the echo modes of the listeners.
     Corrected.
6.   Corrected spoton_kernel::initializeSecurityContainers(). The passphrase
     command-line option relies on the method. Correction also applied
     to version 0.02.
7.   Log listen() errors in the kernel. If the kernel is not listening,
     issue listen() calls periodically.
8.   Corrected kernel event loop. Correction also applied to version 0.02.
9.   Modified the OS X install targets so that the GeoIP.dat file is
     copied to the GeoIP directory.
10.  Removed SPOTON_GEOIP_DATA_FILE from all project files. Please
     see the Settings page's new option for setting the location of the
     GeoIP.dat file.
11.  Removed README.GeoIP.
12.  Added echo_mode to Documentation/ENCRYPTED.
13.  Corrected spoton::slotPopulateNeighbors(). The ssl_key_size field
     contains plaintext data.
14.  The spoton_crypt::decrypted() method will avoid decrypting empty data.
     The action will be considered successful.
15.  Disable GeoIP-related widgets if Spot is not linked with libGeoIP.
16.  The QSslSocket::write() method may fail silently.
     We should not reset the keep-alive timer prematurely.
17.  Update participant status when receiving e-mail and e-mail-retrieval
     requests.
18.  Updated user documentation.

0.02.00 (08/22/2013)

1.   Listen for SSL mode changes on kernel sockets.
2.   Abort plaintext kernel sockets.
3.   Replaced messaging caches with hashes. Messages older than two
     minutes shall be purged.
4.   Corrected Qt 4.6.2 support. The 0.01 branch has been corrected
     as well. Please use Qt 4.8.5 and newer.
5.   Corrected memcpy() argument casts.
6.   Ability to set the Maximum Buffer Size and Maximum Content
     Length. Please see the Neighbors table.
7.   Deactivating a listener will not destroy its children. A new
     control option is available under the Listeners table's context menu.
8.   Prevent control updates of listeners and neighbors that have been
     marked for deletion.
9.   Corrected comments.
10.  Issue gcry_fast_random_poll() before gcry_create_nonce().
11.  SSL certificates and keys will now be created as new connections are
     established. Please remove the listeners.db and neighbors.db databases.
12.  Attempt to correct the connections count in the Listeners table.
13.  Removed spoton_crypt::generateSslKeys(arg1, arg2).
14.  Certificates expire within seven days.
15.  Corrected position of the Listeners table's context menu.
16.  Allow changing of echo modes for listeners. Children remain as
     configured. Eliminated bulky methods.
17.  Removed TTLs. Values can be used to explore Spot graphs.
18.  Congestion control is now enabled by default.
19.  Removed the certificates table from idiotes.db.
20.  Changed message protocols. Functionality with 0.01 is absent.
21.  Added message codes to Buzz messages.
22.  Modified most of spot-on-crypt.cc so that functions that return
     values return empty values on failures.
23.  Removed senseless resizing in spoton_crypt::decrypted().
24.  Added gui/gcryctl_init_secmem and kernel/gcryctl_init_secmem to
     the INI file.
25.  The digital signature that's created during e-mail retrieval has
     been modified so that the signature is generated from a random
     message.
26.  Inspect the signature public key's signature during Repleo processing.
27.  Corrected log entries.
28.  Added Buzz channel types.
29.  The Hash Type combination box was incorrectly populated if libgcrypt
     failed to be initialized properly.
30.  Migrating message types from plaintext to ciphertext, where applicable.
     Task is slow. Please note that although the types are hidden, it
     is possible to guess message types based on the number of groups.
     Problem may be addressed. Please also note that one may be able
     to distinguish ciphertexts produced from asymmetric ciphers and
     symmetric ciphers.
31.  Generate scrambled messages for an assortment of message types.
32.  Allow neighbors to be detached from listener parents. Please
     see the Listeners table's context menu.
33.  The interface had a habit of periodically sending repetitive information
     to the kernel. Corrected.
34.  Modified Buzz channel keys. Instead of using the channel name as the key,
     gcry_kdf_derive() is used to generate a key. Unfortunately, the
     salt cannot be random and is based on the channel name and channel
     type. An optional salt may be provided. If possible, please improve
     the mechanism without introducing a distribution puzzle.
35.  Added support for Linux on the PowerPC architecture.
36.  The message_code field in email.db has been deprecated.
37.  Decipher Buzz messages in the kernel.
38.  Do not attempt to decipher messages in the kernel that require
     an interface instance.
39.  Long distance calling. Please see the Participant table's context
     menu.
40.  Use strong random bytes for status message keys.
41.  Use QVariant(QVariant::ByteArray), or equivalent, when attempting
     to store null database entries.
42.  Replaced QApplication::processEvents() with repaint(). processEvents()
     may cause problems on older versions of Qt.
43.  Optional signatures added to various communication protocols.
44.  Do not prompt for kernel activation if the kernel path does not represent
     an executable.
45.  Corrected UTF-8 issues in Buzz channels.
46.  Buzz channels will now accept UTF-8.
47.  The haveged package may increase the entropy on FreeBSD and Linux
     systems. Highly recommended.
48.  Replaced socket readyRead() signals in the kernel with 1.5-seconds
     timers. The change should alleviate burdened kernels. However,
     excessive data accumulation may occur.
49.  Qt 5.1 QHostAddress(QString) interprets IPv4 octets as octal values
     if the values are represented as such. For example, 192.168.178.015
     is interpreted as 192.168.178.13. Spot shall interpret IPv4 user
     input as is.
50.  Corrected notifications of Buzz activity.
51.  Replaced QSsl::TlsV1_2 with QSsl::SecureProtocols for Qt 5.x.
52.  Removed /echo/ instances from various hypertexts.
53.  spoton_listener::prepareNetworkInterface() must be called after
     an attempt of listen() is made. Otherwise, QTcpServer::serverAddress()
     will return an invalid address and cause the listener to exit
     prematurely.
54.  Gemini creation shall now be applied per participant instead
     of groups of participants.
55.  All new connections shall now have the stickies enabled by default.
56.  The gemini field in the friends_public_keys database table will
     now assume a null value.
57.  Signature keys in the friends_public_keys database table will be labeled
     as unknown (name).
58.  Corrected uses of QSqlQuery::isNull() and QByteArray::isNull().
     QByteArray::isNull() instances have been replaced by
     QByteArray::isEmpty().

0.01.00 (07/27/2013)

1.   Version 0.01 of Spot-On is now available.

0.00.00 (08/08/2011)

1.   Spot-On ascends from Ne.R.D.D. (registered on 06/27/2010).
     Perhaps nice things shall follow.
