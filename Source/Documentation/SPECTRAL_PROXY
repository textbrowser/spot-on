A Spectral Human Proxy is a proxy of a proxy of ... a proxy. For example,
person A specifies B as a proxy and B specifies C as a proxy and C specifies
D as a proxy, etc. A receiver R receiving a message from A is actually
receiving a message from X. Every proxy which is able to decipher a message
will then transfer the message through its own proxy. The message may
be lost because of some inconsistent proxy or it may arrive. Spectral human
proxies create spectral decompositions through the Echo machinery.
