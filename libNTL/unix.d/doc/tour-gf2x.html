A Tour of NTL: Using NTL with the GF2X library
</p>
</h1>

<p> <hr> <p>

GF2X is a library for fast multiplication 
of polynomials over <i>GF(2)</i>.
The GF2X library was developed by Emmanuel Thom&eacute;,
Paul Zimmermmann, Pierrick Gaudry, and Richard Brent.

<p>

Unlike NTL, which only imlements a version of Karatsuba multiplication,
GF2X implements other algorithms that are faster
for very large degree polynomials.
If you use NTL if the GF2X library,
then multiplication, division, GCD, and minimum polynomal
calculations for the <a href="GF2X.cpp.html">GF2X</a> class will 
be faster for large degree polymials.

<p>
For example,
based on benchmarks on an Intel Xeon Platinum 8175M (which is 
the server configuration of the Skylake microarchitecture),
compared to NTL's default implementation,
the GF2X library is 1.4x faster at multiplying polynomials
of degree 1,000 over <i>GF(2)</i>, 
and 2.1x faster at multiplying polynomials of degree 1,000,000.


<p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> GF2X is thread safe, so you should feel free to use it
in a thread-safe build of NTL.
However, it is 
<i>not</i> entirely exception friendly (it may
abort a running program, but only in some very extreme and
unusal circumstances).

<h2>
Downloading and building GF2X
</h2>
<p>

Download GF2X from <a href="https://gitlab.inria.fr/gf2x/gf2x">here.</a>
This is a gitlab page that allows you to clone a git repository.
If you do not want to use git, you
you can also just download
<tt>gf2x-XXX.tar.gz</tt> 
(both options are accessible through the "code" tab on that page).
<p>
Assuming you have downloaded  <tt>gf2x-XXX.tar.gz</tt>, 
do the following:
<pre>
   % tar -xf gf2x-XXX.tar
   % cd gf2x-XXX
   % autoreconf -i
   % ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
   % make
   % make check
   % make install
</pre>
Note the line "<tt>autoreconf -i</tt>". 
This is needed because GF2X is distributed without a configure script.
Rather, the configure script has to be built using <tt>autoreconf</tt>,
which is a part of the GNU autotools suite.
Depending on your system, you may have to install GNU autotools
before you can build GF2X.
<p>
This will build, test, and install GF2X in <tt>$HOME/.local</tt>.
Of course, change <tt>$HOME/.local</tt> to whatever you want.
You will find the GF2X header files in <tt>$HOME/.local/include</tt> 
and the compiled binaries in <tt>$HOME/.local/lib</tt>.

<p>
By default, this is will install both a static and shared library.
You can supply the option
<tt>--disable-shared</tt> to the <tt>configure</tt> script,
if you only want static libraries.
If you do this, you may also consider passing the <tt>--with-pic</tt>
option if you want another shared library to be able to call functions
in GF2X. 


<p>

When building NTL with GF2X, you have to tell NTL that you want to
use it.
To do this,
pass the argument 
<tt>NTL_GF2X_LIB=on</tt> to the NTL configure script
when you are <a href="tour-unix.html">installing NTL</a>.


<p>
You need to make sure that the NTL configure script knows
where to find GF2X when you are builing NTL.
You can do this by passing <tt>GF2X_PREFIX=$HOME/.local</tt>
or <tt>DEF_PREFIX=$HOME/.local</tt> to NTL's configure script.
<p>
For example, if NTL, GMP, and GF2X are all being installed
in <tt>$HOME/.local</tt>, invoke NTL's configure script like this:
<pre>
   % ./configure DEF_PREFIX=$HOME/.local NTL_GF2X_LIB=on 
</pre>

<p>
Also when you link and run a program that uses NTL,
you have to make sure that the GF2X library is found 
at link time and, depending on the system, possibly at run time.
The best way to see how to do this is to look at the
file <tt>USER_MAKEFILE.txt</tt> installed in NTL's include
directory &mdash; again, see <a href="tour-unix.html">here</a>
for details.

<p>
When using NTL with GF2X, 
as a user of NTL, you do not need to
know or understand anything about the the GF2X library.
